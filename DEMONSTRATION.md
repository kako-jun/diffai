## 🧪 Live Examples

### 1. Basic JSON Comparison

**Command**: `diffai config_v1.json config_v2.json`

**Output**:
```
    ~ app.settings.log_level: "info" -> "debug"
  ~ app.version: "1.0" -> "1.1"
```

**What this shows**: diffai correctly identifies and displays structural differences in JSON files with clear before/after values.

### 2. ML Model Analysis (SafeTensors)

**Command**: `diffai model1.safetensors model2.safetensors --architecture-comparison --memory-analysis`

**Output**:
```
architecture_comparison: type1=feedforward, type2=feedforward, depth=6→6, differences=0, deployment_readiness=ready, "safe_to_upgrade"
  ~ fc1.bias: mean=0.0018->0.0017, std=0.0518->0.0647
  ~ fc1.weight: mean=-0.0002->-0.0001, std=0.0514->0.0716
  ~ fc2.bias: mean=-0.0076->-0.0257, std=0.0661->0.0973
  ~ fc2.weight: mean=-0.0008->-0.0018, std=0.0719->0.0883
  ~ fc3.bias: mean=-0.0074->-0.0130, std=0.1031->0.1093
  ~ fc3.weight: mean=-0.0035->-0.0010, std=0.0990->0.1113
memory_analysis: delta=+0.0MB, gpu_est=0.1MB, efficiency=1.000000, review_friendly="optimal_no_action_needed"
```

**What this shows**: diffai provides sophisticated ML model analysis including:
- Architecture compatibility assessment
- Layer-by-layer statistical differences
- Memory impact analysis
- Deployment readiness evaluation

---

### 3. Programmatic JSON Output

**Command**: `diffai config_v1.json config_v2.json --output json`

**Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "Modified": [
      "app.settings.log_level",
      "info",
      "debug"
    ]
  },
  {
    "Modified": [
      "app.version",
      "1.0",
      "1.1"
    ]
  }
]
```

**What this shows**: Machine-readable output for CI/CD integration and automation.

### 4. Verbose Mode Diagnostics

**Command**: `diffai config_v1.json config_v2.json --verbose`

**Output**:
```
=== diffai verbose mode enabled ===
Configuration:
  Input format: None
  Output format: Cli
  Recursive mode: false

File analysis:
  Input 1: tests/fixtures/config_v1.json
  Input 2: tests/fixtures/config_v2.json
  Detected format: Json
  File 1 size: 128 bytes
  File 2 size: 129 bytes

Processing results:
  Total processing time: 198.000µs
  Differences found: 2
  Format-specific analysis: Json

    ~ app.settings.log_level: "info" -> "debug"
  ~ app.version: "1.0" -> "1.1"
```

**What this shows**: Detailed processing information for debugging and understanding diffai's analysis process.
