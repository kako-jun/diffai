## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] - 2025-07-14
### 🐛 Critical Fixes
- **Fixed PyPI package distribution**: Resolved maturin build error "Defining scripts and working with a binary doesn't mix well"
- **Removed conflicting Python script definition**: Eliminated duplicate `diffai` command definition in `[project.scripts]`
- **Unified command interface**: All packages now provide `diffai` command exclusively through Rust binary

### 📦 Package Distribution
- **Rust (crates.io)**: `diffai-core` and `diffai-cli` v0.3.4
- **JavaScript (npm)**: `diffai-js` v0.3.4 with cross-platform binaries  
- **Python (PyPI)**: `diffai-python` v0.3.4 with working wheel distribution

### 🔄 Infrastructure Improvements
- Enhanced release automation and CI/CD robustness
- Dynamic version handling to prevent hardcoded version issues
- Comprehensive test suite improvements for all packages
- Migration from diffx architecture improvements

### 📝 Documentation & Testing
- Added comprehensive verbose mode documentation
- Enhanced CLI behavior standardization
- Complete test coverage for npm and Python packages

## [0.2.9] - 2025-07-12
### 🚀 Features
- **Verbose mode (`--verbose`/`-v`)**: Comprehensive diagnostic output with configuration, file analysis, and performance metrics
- **Fixed recursive directory behavior**: Now matches standard diff behavior - auto-detect directories, `--recursive` controls depth
- **Multi-language verbose documentation**: Complete guides in English, Japanese, and Chinese

### 🔧 Improvements  
- **Package updates**: Added `--verbose` and `--recursive` options to Python and npm packages
- **Documentation fixes**: Replaced non-existent CLI options (`--stream`, `--threads`, `--shape-only`, `--check`) with working alternatives
- **CLI behavior standardization**: Directory comparison now works like standard diff (without flags for basic, `--recursive` for deep)
- **Binary distribution**: Added diffai binaries to both Python and npm packages

### 🛠️ Technical Changes
- Enhanced Python package with verbose mode support
- Updated npm package with recursive and verbose options, removed non-existent `--quiet`
- Complete documentation consistency across all languages
- Improved error handling and user experience
